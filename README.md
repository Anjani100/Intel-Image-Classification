# Intel-Image-Classification
A classifier model to classify images of buildings, forest, glacier, mountain, sea and street.

## Setup
The following packages are used in this entire project:
* Python (Version: 3.6.9) - You can install python from the following [link](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
* Numpy - To install numpy, just fire up a command prompt/terminal and type the following text: *pip install numpy*
* OpenCV - pip install opencv-python
* Scikit-learn - pip install scikit-learn
* Tensorflow - We're going to use the GPU version of Tensorflow. Installation Link: [Sentdex](https://pythonprogramming.net/how-to-cuda-gpu-tensorflow-deep-learning-tutorial/)

## The Plan

* Firstly, we are going to build up a Neural Network from scratch and observe our model's performance.
